- 👋 Hi, I’m @saziton
- 👀 I’m interested in open source projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various web stacks (notably pocketbase + svelte)
- 💞️ I’m looking to people collaborate on https://gitlab.com/saxziton1/dumiste.fr/, a website that colaboratively enrich musescore.com scores with metadata and tags and allow to them ti be rsearched. It's meant for music educators and beyond.
